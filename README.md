# NashJS GameDev

## Installation of Front End Components

1. Install Node dependencies: `$ npm install`
2. `$ grunt` will watch for changes as you develop, running unit tests as necessary. `Ctrl-C` will kill this
  process.

### JavaScript Unit Tests

1. Ensure Grunt is installed globally: `$ npm install -g grunt-cli`
2. Install Node dependencies (if you haven't already): `$ npm install`
3. Run the tests: `$ grunt test`

JS unit tests are written in the `public/js/test/` directory. Try to make
the file structure match that of the `public/js/` directory.
